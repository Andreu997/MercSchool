MercSchool is a game designed by Rodrigo de Pedro Lombao and Andreu Sacasas as a project for the Artificial Inteligence subject in UPC school with the objective of developing 3 different agents that interact between themselves and they sourroundings depending on their objectives and necessities.

#1. Environment
Champion school is played in a 2D world simulating the schoolâ€™s building land. The map area is limited by boundaries.

##1.1 Game areas

The school area is divided in three areas with own features:

```markdown
School: this is where students will live, train and rest. The main purpose of this zone is to improve recruits skills. Players can spend money on new buildings only in this zone. This zone will never grant money to the player.

Arena: in this zone students will fight against competitors of other schools, granting money to the player if victorious. Functionality is further described in the Arena section.

School outskirts: this zone includes the outside field of the school. At night, bandits will come to try to attack the school, which must be defended by the students.


##1.2 Day/Night cycle:

During daytime: - The school and the arena are open, and students will focus on training or battling in the arena. While on day, the player will be able to decide if the soldiers train or rest depending on their health and stamina, and there will be the option to buy new soldiers if the player has enough money.

At night: - The school and the arena are closed, and the player is unable to build or upgrade. - Bandits will attack the students, coming from the outskirts in waves. The students will focus on defeat them.
